Hello there!

In this post I will present the tools I am using for this project. There will be separate posts with detailed explanations when necessary. Please keep in mind that since this is an ongoing project, the list of tools will definitely expand over time. I will always come back to update this post with the latest additions.

### Raspberry Pi 4

As the foundational hardware for this project, I chose the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. This compact yet powerful single-board computer is well-suited for managing the demands of satellite tracking. Here are the key specifications of the Raspberry Pi that I am utilizing:

* **Memory**: 2GB LPDDR4 RAM.
* **Processor**: 64-bit quad-core Cortex-AT2 processor.
* **Video Output**: 2 micro HDMI ports.
* **Connectivity**: Gigabit Ethernet port.
* **USB Ports**: 2 USB 3.0 ports and 2 USB 2.0 ports.

For a detailed description of how to set up the Raspberry Pi 4, please read [this post](/setup-raspberry-pi.html).
