Hello there!

In this post I will present the tools I am using for this project. There will be separate posts with detailed explanations when necessary. Please keep in mind that since this is an ongoing project, the list of tools will definitely expand over time. I will always come back to update this post with the latest additions.

### Raspberry Pi 4
